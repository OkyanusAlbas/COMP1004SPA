Steps for Running the App Locally:

    Install Dependencies:
        Run npm install to install all the dependencies listed in package.json.
    Start the Development Server:
        Run npm run dev to start the Vite development server for the front-end.
    Start the Backend Server:
        Run npm run serve to start the json-server mock API on port 5000. This will simulate a backend for user and password data.
