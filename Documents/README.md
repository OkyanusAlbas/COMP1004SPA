Cyber Security
The focus of this project is to provide a password account management system for a user
accessed via a browser.
Produce a hand coded application whereby an individual can manage their own passwords
and accounts for different applications. As a minimum your application should provide the
following functionality:
• Use local storage to store personal account data such as username and password.
• Read a JSON file using the format above to identify a matching username in your
system.
• Indicate password strength to the end user.
You will need to determine what additional features this application should have and the
best way to visualise this information for the user.
Make Main Page when on top user can register to the website with a registration form and a login form after they log in they will be able to have access to the features of the website each account a user creates will have uniqe settings passwords emails and usernames so when registerin user need to enter Username email password twice. when logging in they will just enter (username or email) and password and login.  


I need a Home page where There is a title bar showing Password Manager
under it there should be navigation bar Showing Register/Login after when you click on it it will lead you login page if you dont have a account there should be register button in blue that leads you to register page Loginpage(username, email, password) RegisterPage(username, email, password password) it has two password parts because when registering it should check iff bot passwords are correct also add more checks like username is alreadyu taken email is to weak email is already registered, for login page add check wrong username email, wrong password. if you registered it should automaticaly lead you to register page also add a login button in blue in register page also to go back incase they miss clicked make sure they are orderly and in nice vertical fromat form for login and register if you succesfully register data should be written to data.json after you login you go back to home page where instead of Login/Register there should be your account username next to it logout button that logs out for you. ok now after you login web page should display the app i want to make which is you create a box with + button add Title password and description it should also have save button where it saves the settings and changes made for the user no other user should be able to see it also include how to set up dependencies#
